    "## The vanishing gradient problem in RNNs\n",
    "For the calculation of the gradients of the loss with respect to the hidden-to-hidden weights $W_{hh}$ over the whole time-steps with backpropagation, we can obtain the following expression: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial W_{hh}} = \\sum_{t}^{T} \\sum_{k=1}^{t+1} \\frac{\\partial L_{t+1}}{\\partial \\hat{y}_{t+1}} \\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}_{t+1}}{\\partial h_{t+1}} \\frac{\\partial h_{t+1}}{\\partial h_{k}}\\frac{\\partial h_{k}}{\\partial W_{hh}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And for the gradients of the loss with respect to the input-to-hidden weights $W_{xh}$ over the whole time-steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial L} {\\partial W_{xh}} = \\sum_{t}^{T} \\sum_{k=1}^{t+1} \\frac{\\partial L_{t+1}}{\\partial \\hat{y}_{t+1}} \\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}_{t+1}}{\\partial h_{t+1}} \\frac{\\partial h_{t+1}}{\\partial h_{k}} \\frac{\\partial h_{k}}{\\partial W_{xh}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context the term $\\frac{\\partial h_{t+1}}{\\partial h_{k}}$ it's a sort of \"chain rule\" for the derivatives with respect to the other hidden states in oter time-steps. In example, $\\frac{\\partial h_{3}}{\\partial h_{1}} = \\frac{\\partial h_{3}}{\\partial h_{2}}\\frac{\\partial h_{2}}{\\partial h_{1}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "An equivalent form for $\\frac{\\partial h_{t+1}}{\\partial h_{k}}$ is:\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial h_{t+1}}{\\partial h_k} = \\prod^{t}_{j=k} \\frac{\\partial h_{j+1}}{\\partial h_{j}}  = \\frac{\\partial h_{t+1}}{\\partial h_{t}}\\frac{\\partial h_{t}}{\\partial h_{t-1}}...\\frac{\\partial h_{k+1}}{\\partial h_k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each one of the terms $\\frac{\\partial h_{j+1}}{\\partial h_{j}}$ are jacobian matrices so the gradients of the loss with respect to $W_{hh}$ and $W_{xh}$ are matrix multiplications between a large amount of terms. Performing an analysis to the jacobian matrices one can rise the conclusion that, with enough matrix multiplications, if the largest eigenvalue $\\lambda_{1} <1$ then the gradient will vanish (tend to zero) while if the value of $\\lambda_{1} > 1$ the gradient explodes (goes to infinity). This effect can be potentiated by the activation functions since the derivative of most of the activation functions has a maximum of 1 and depends on the gradients so if the gradients goes down the derivative of the activation functions follows it."
